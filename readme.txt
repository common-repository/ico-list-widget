== Description ==

The ICO List Widget plugin adds a useful widget with a list of live and upcoming cryptocurrency ICOs.
Now your site can have an updated ICO list!
   
This plugin lets you add a table of live and upcoming cryptocurrency ICO (initial coin offering) projects on your website's content and sidebar.

The ICO projects are updated regularly from one of the most comprehensive ICO databases (icowatchlist.com) so your site is always up to date and your visitors will keep coming back from updates. 

**Functionality**
Once installed, the plugin offers some key functions to blend nicely with your site's design and increase overall engagement on your site.

You can add the widget to any section of your site or use the shortcode generator on the plugin settings page.

Pick the number of ICOs you would like the widget to show initially. Your site's visitors will be able to page forward to see more and more ICO projects.
You can also select the colors and how to display the progress, date or countdown of the project.
